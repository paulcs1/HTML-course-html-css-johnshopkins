<h1>Top Players in Major League Baseball</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p>Trout is considered the best all-around player of his time. His combination of high average and power make him a formidable presence in the middle of the order. He is consistently among the league leaders in walks and his blazing speed make him an asset on the base paths and in the field. At 29 years old, Trout has already accumulated 3 MVP awards, 8 All-Star Selections, 290 home runs, and 200 stolen bases. He recently signed a 13-year extension that will make him a member of the Angels for the rest of his career, and he is certain to be enshrined in Cooperstown when he retires.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><p>Betts established himself as a franchise cornerstone during his years with the Red Sox. He has won four straight Gold Glove awards in right field due to his incredible range and his strong, accurate arm. From 2015-2019, Betts averaged 43 doubles, 27 home runs, and 24 stolen bases. He won the MVP award in 2018 and helped the Red Sox win the World Series. His strong work ethic and affable demeanor have made him a fan favorite. Traded to the Dodgers before the 2020 season, Betts hopes to bring a World Championship to Los Angeles.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"><p>Yelich was a good player with the Marlins, but his performance reached new heights after he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers. He batted .326 with 36 HR in 2018 en route to an MVP award and a postseason berth for the Brewers. He was even better in 2019, batting .329 with 44 home runs before a knee injury ended his season. He signed a 9 year/$215 million deal that will allow him to remain the face of the franchise for years to come. </p></div>
